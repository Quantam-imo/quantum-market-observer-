  ✅ HTF / LTF bias (always updated)
     Why the market is tradable
  
  ✅ Session structure (entry context)
     What happened yesterday/today
  
  ✅ Iceberg zones (read-only)
     Where institutions may defend

What You Still Cannot Do:
  ❌ Override entry
  ❌ Modify stop
  ❌ Change targets
  ❌ Trade different sessions

Rules Still Enforced:
  • Same 1 trade per session

Duration: 30–60 days total
Exit Criteria:

Rules Evolve:

  • AI supervision active (all deviations logged)

New Responsibility:
  • You choose exact entry price (within zone)
  • You manage position more actively
  • You decide when to scale
  • You are accountable for decisions

AI Supervision:
  ⚠️  AI logs every override
  ⚠️  AI analyzes your choices
  ⚠️  AI warns of behavioral issues
  ⚠️  Poor execution → downgrade possible

Duration: 60–120 days total
Exit Criteria:
  ✅ 98%+ rule compliance
  ✅ NO revenge trading
  ✅ 120+ calendar days passed
  ✅ 60+ trades completed
  ✅ 50%+ win rate

  • All sessions available
  • Multi-day trades allowed
  • Scaling allowed

AI Role Shifts:
  🔍 AI is now an auditor
  🔍 AI monitors, does not control
  🔍 AI flags anomalies
  🔍 AI does NOT block trades

Responsibility Fully Yours:
  • You control risk
  • You control entries
  • You control exits
  • You control position management

Rules Still Matter:
  ⚠️  Daily loss limit: 2R (hard stop)
  ⚠️  No revenge trading
  ⚠️  Position sizing must be proportional
  ⚠️  Leverage prohibited

What This Teaches:
  → True discretion
  → Real accountability
  → System mastery
  → Advanced execution

█ AUTOMATIC DOWNGRADE (Safety Mechanism)

If you violate core rules, you downgrade:

Downgrade to Phase 2 if:
  ❌ > 3 consecutive losses
  ❌ Revenge trading detected
  ❌ > 2 rule violations in a day
  ❌ Equity drawdown > 10%

Downgrade to Phase 1 if:
  ❌ Monthly loss
  ❌ Blow account > 15%
  ❌ Repeated behavioral issues

Why?
  → Protects capital
  → Forces reset
  → Prevents emotional ruin

█ WHY THIS SYSTEM WORKS

Traditional Training:
  ❌ Give everything to everyone
  ❌ Most people quit or blow accounts
  ❌ No accountability structure
  ❌ Too much freedom too early

Your Progressive System:
  ✅ Build skills systematically
  ✅ Prevent common failures
  ✅ Accountability at each level
  ✅ Freedom earned, not given

It's Like Martial Arts:
  White belt: Learn basics
  Blue belt: Add combinations
  Purple belt: Add discretion
  Black belt: Full mastery

█ COMMON QUESTIONS

Q: Can I skip phases?
A: No. Progression is automatic but requires all criteria.

Q: What if I violate rules?
A: You get warnings, then downgrade if repeated.

Q: Can I go back up after downgrade?
A: Yes, by proving discipline again (same criteria).

Q: What if I want to be Full Pro immediately?
A: Trade perfectly for 120 days. That's the requirement.

Q: What if I plateau?
A: Common. Take a break, then continue. No rush.

█ FINAL WORDS ON PROGRESSION

This system is designed like a professional firm:
  → Juniors are restricted (protect capital)
  → Experience unlocks freedom
  → Freedom requires responsibility
  → Irresponsibility gets restricted

You earn your way up.
You can lose your way down.
That's how professionals build careers.
