## How They Work Together

```
Every 5 seconds:
    ▼
All 11 memories are queried
    ▼
Confidence calculated from multiple angles:
├─ Trade Memory: "72% historical win rate"
├─ Iceberg Memories: "Zone tested 12 times, 71% success"
├─ Session Learning: "This session: best setup identified"
├─ Edge Decay: "Edge strength 76% (strong)"
├─ Performance Memory: "R:R ratio 2.7:1"
├─ Cycle Memory: "Cycle inflection in 23 bars"
├─ Signal Memory: "Signal type has 64% win rate"
├─ News Memory: "No major events this hour"
└─ Structure Memory: "All timeframes aligned"
    ▼
CONVERGED CONFIDENCE = 85-95%
    ▼
AI MENTOR: "✅ EXECUTE with 95% confidence"
    ▼
Trade taken, outcome recorded
    ▼
All 11 memories UPDATED
    ▼
System becomes SMARTER for next trade

## Testing the Memory Engines

### **Quick Verification** (5 minutes)
```bash
cd /workspaces/quantum-market-observer-

# Check all memories exist
python -m pytest backend/memory/ -v

# Result: ✓ All 11 pass
```

### **Full Integration Test** (15 minutes)
```bash
# Test memories working together
python -m pytest test_step23_first.py -v

# Watch live updates
watch -n 5 'curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/v1/mentor -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"symbol\":\"GC=F\",\"interval\":\"5m\"}" | jq ".confidence_percent"'
```

### **Production Testing** (1 month)
```bash
# Follow the ONE_MONTH_TESTING_GUIDE.md
# Track daily KPIs from MEMORY_ENGINES_HOWTO.md
# Watch system learn and improve week by week
```

## Key Concepts to Remember

### **1. Convergence**
Single memory = unreliable
Multiple memories → same signal = VERY reliable

Example: When 8 different memories all say "trade with 95% confidence"
= Time to execute!

### **2. Adaptation**
System learns which setups work in each session
After 30 days: "In London, always use icebergs first"
= Professional-grade adaptive strategy

### **3. Edge Tracking**
Position size = base × edge_strength
Strong edge (0.8) = larger positions
Weak edge (0.3) = smaller positions
Dead edge (<0.2) = skip this setup
= Automatic risk management

### **4. Learning Loop**
Every trade → Outcome recorded → Memories updated → Smarter next time
= Continuous improvement
